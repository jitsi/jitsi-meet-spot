# Jitsi-Meet Spot

This is the mono-repo for Jitsi Meet's room integration, named Spot. This project is fairly independent of jitsi-meet (the web UI codebase) but it consumes Jitsi Meet through jitsi-meet's iFrame API.

- spot-admin/ contains a mock server for testing integration between Spot and a backend service
- spot-client/ contains the Spot-TV and Spot-Remote codebase. This is the main application folder.
- spot-controller/ contains the iOS and Android application for the Spot-Remote. It shows the spot-client in a webview.
- spot-electron/ contains the desktop application for displaying a Spot-TV in an iframe. It has additional functionality on top of what the spot-client can provide.
- spot-integrations-service is a backend service used for facilitating joining meetings from providers other than jitsi. For example, the service provides a signed meeting number for Spot to use when joining a zoom meeting.
- spot-webdriver/ contains selenium webdriver tests for spot-client

# Spot SDKs
Some of Spot's code has been created outside of the mono repo.
- [Jitsi Spot SDK](https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-spot-sdk) for react-native applications to show the Spot controller.
- [Spot Electron SDK](https://github.com/jitsi/spot-electron-sdk) for other electron applications communicate with the Spot-TV webview.

## Known limitations
- Spot-TV currently supports latest Chrome only
- Spot-Remotes are full-featured in Chrome but also supports reduced functionality in mobile browsers, Safari, and Firefox.
